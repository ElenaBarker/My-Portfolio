          I am a motivated, confident, and enthusiastic professional with over 5 years of experience in the social sector. I am currently transitioning to a career in tech after successfully completing an intensive 12-month software development program at CodeYourFuture in London.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Through CodeYourFutureâ€™s immersive curriculum, I gained extensive technical skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and other core technologies. I am currently enhancing these skills in their Cloud module, where I am learning to use Amazon Web Services like EC2, S3, and RDS.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          My background in the social sector instilled in me a passion for helping others and making a positive impact. As a developer, I am excited to use my new skills to build accessible, user-friendly applications that can benefit society.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Outside of programming, I enjoy outdoor activities with my husband and 9 years old son, learning foreign languages, and volunteering in my community. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities for personal growth.
